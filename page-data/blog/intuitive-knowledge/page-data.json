It's that breakthrough \"aha!\" moment. In my experience it happens randomly and only after a long and frustrating period of trying to learn something new. I remember when I first started at Reclub I was overwhelmed by the amount of new information I had to learn. Everything was difficult and I saw senior engineers completing tasks in 15 minutes that would take me a day. Going to them for help wasn't much help actually. They would give me an answer but I could not wrap my head around HOW they got to that answer. Watching them work it felt like they would look at the problem and the right answer would magically appear in the their mind. The deep knowledge they possessed meant they abstracted away many things which a beginner didn't even know.</p>\n<p>The same thing happens to me when I teach Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I can show a class some basic sequence of movements and during the demonstration it looks quite simple. But once the class begins to drill the technique its like somehow they just cant do it. This repeated observation made me realize that sometimes black belts, native language speakers and senior software engineers are not the best teachers for beginners. The gap of knowledge between the two is simply too wide and unless the teacher is constantly conscious of this gap, the student is often left feeling lost. This is why a lot of native speakers do not make good language instructors. If you show them a sentence with a grammatical mistake they can instantly identify the mistake and tell you the right answer but they cannot explain HOW they got to that answer.</p>\n<p>The solution to this problem is scaling the mentors. Newbie developers would benefit most from sitting with junior engineers. Blue belts would be better instructors for white belts than black belts. And non native speakers can understand the struggles their students are having because they have been there as well. I think we all have a tendency to quickly forget what it was like to be a beginner at something. Our way of thinking is always pointed forward. More knowledge, more skills, more results. But what about the skill of teaching? In my opinion that is one of the rarest skills to be had.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intuitive Knowledge","author":"Igor Tatarinov","date":"11 November, 2020"},"excerpt":"The topic of intuition has always held a deep interest for me.
